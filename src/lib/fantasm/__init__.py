Release Notes:

v1.2.1
- fixed bug related to default serialization of ndb.Key on fan-in states

v1.2.0
- allow the capabilities check to be configured with "enable_capabilties_check" in fantasm.yaml (default True)
- fixed https://code.google.com/p/fantasm/issues/detail?id=8
- fixes https://code.google.com/p/fantasm/issues/detail?id=10

v1.1.1
- very minor bug fix

v1.1.0
- added fantasm.exceptions.HaltMachineError; when raised the machine will be stopped without needing
  to specify "final: True" on the state. Normally if a None event is returned from a "final: False"
  state, Fantasm complains loudly. HaltMachineError provides a way to kill a machine without this
  loud complaint in the logs, though the HaltMachineError allows you to provide a log message and
  a log level to log at (logLevel=None means do not emit a message at all).

v1.0.1
- fixed an issue with context.setQueue()

v1.0.0
- we've been out for a long time, but never had formal release notes. Gotta start somewhere!
